# RESUMES  
  
**I have no experience. I have too much experience. Where do I start?**  
Writing a resume can be a confusing process. There are many differing opinions as to how to format the document, how to explain gaps and even how to market experience from a different (non-technical) field. We will cover Do's and Don'ts, and also have an in-depth discussion about common issues.  
  
### Assignment

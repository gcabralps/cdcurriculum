# NETWORKING  
  
**Networking is not a transactional relationship, it's leveraging someone's reputation for an opportunity**  
Who can you connect with to help you find a job? Networking is more than asking for a favor ("please hire me!"), it's about creating relationships, maintaining them and giving back. We will discuss networking strategies, ways to connect authentically and the best avenues to do so.
